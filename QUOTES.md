I will definitely be referencing RadGrad in the future when I apply for Spring 2022 classes.

I did not realize the number of opportunities that UH Manoa offered for women and minorities. I am particularly interested in the Society of Women Engineers at UH Manoa. This is my first year at UH Manoa and I haven't had many opportunities to meet like-minded individuals with similar interests.

I was surprised how easy RadGrad was to use. The design of it was very pleasing to the eye and easy to navigate. I also believe trying to rack up ICE points makes the experience a lot more enjoyable. Unlike other websites, I had an easy time understanding what each function did.

I think as I progress in school it will really come in handy for networking and building my resume.

I really enjoyed the snappy and stateful structure of the app, and the layout was pleasing and simple enough for easy navigation.

The ability to "level up" is personally enticing, as well.

I would rethink the approach to laying out courses and opportunities within the Planner. Specifically, I think it's important to communicate to the student user the delineation between the purposes of course planning within RadGrad and within STAR.

When adding things to my profile, I would like to have a button or option to just straight up add the interest instead of having to click "See Details/Add to Profile" > click "Add to Profile" > wait for the green checkmark animation to finish > go back to the courses/opportunities/whatever.

Seeing detailed descriptions of courses and opportunities, setting your interests, COURSE REVIEWS (SUPER COOL LOVE THIS), and a planner that is 50000000x better than STAR is super awesome.

I was first impressed with RADGRAD's design and the layout was well done.

My favorite part of the whole RadGrad experience was looking into what my interests are because I discovered a bunch of different skills/interests that I did not even know existed!

The point system they created motivated me to look through the wide variety of classes and opportunities

I appreciate how it recommends courses, opportunities, and experiences based on stated goals and interests, as well as the ability to plan out a degree path in advance.

The only issue I have with it is that it does not seem to differentiate at all between ICS majors and other students.

I plan on using RadGrad regularly throughout my pursuit into the Software Engineer field.

I thought that it was cool that they suggested some careers and extra-curriculars based on your interests and career goals.

A con I found was that I didn't plan on taking so much classes (maybe one or two more after this class) in ICS but it made me add a bunch of classes to complete the task even though I was hesitant on adding so many courses.

What I like about this application is that it provides feedback from other students.

some small quality of life improvements could be introduced such as STAR integration so we don't have to manually enter in all the classes that we are slated to take already.

it was a little overwhelming to add-in 17 classes into a three / four-year plan as someone who isn’t an ICS major.

As a first impression, the website was neat and easy to navigate.

I like how the website sectioned that to-do list because one step leads to another and it made it very organized.

It was a little difficult getting the hang of RadGrad, but I'm glad the tutorial was very thorough. I liked how the tutorial also had screenshots and a goal at the bottom of each page to ensure we did what we were supposed to.

Starting off, RadGrad was intimidating. I felt like it wouldn't been overwhelming and stressful thinking about the future and how I have so much I have to do. However, I came to be the opposite. Instead, it made me feel comfortable and intrigued with all the opportunities, courses, paths, etc. I found myself wanting to do a lot of things right now.

I also like how there are three categories of experience that give optimal balance of experience, and how you can plan events and classes up until the last semester you plan to be in college. Everyone always talks about needing more than just grades in order to find a good job and have a good resume, and Radgrad is one of the only things that I know that facilitates all of this.

I also like the option to be able to see other people who has similar interests as I do, and maybe work together with them on assignments in order to help both of us out.

One thing that I didn't like too much about Radgrad was the fact that you have to plan out almost everything in order to "complete" Radgrad.

A suggestion I have is that as most people would probably be taking classes with star, it could be useful to be able to transfer class information between the two sites.

RadGrad makes networking with people with the same interest as you easy.

This website also allows me to meet people who have the same hobbies as me.

I wish that my school the University of Minnesota had a system like this. This is a very streamlined process that has extracurriculars right there that would be very helpful even after the degree. At my home school, all of these resources are on different websites and can be hard to find and figure out, especially degree progress and which courses need to be taken, and in which order.

RadGrad presented many opportunities and courses that I didn't even know existed.

My experience with RadGrad was eye-opening and shocking. At first, I was overwhelmed by the number of opportunities provided for me throughout my college years. In addition, it made me realize the number of professions that I could choose from by completing my computer science degree. I always thought that I could only choose from being a programmer for a company or be a game developer. However, after going through RadGrad, I can view the many professions I could choose, creating a wider variety of opportunities.

I found the User interface to be confusing.

The only thing I thought was confusing was the number of classes I could take in one semester because I still trying to figure out how to fulfill my degree requirement with non-CS classes.

I also enjoy that I can create my personal planner of future courses and opportunities to pursue, so that I have my set of goals in an organized fashion to be able to engage them step by step. With RadGrad's myICE, I can see what skills I need to improve on to become a successful undergraduate and future professional.

Sometimes, college students have trouble finding extracurricular activities, and RadGrad organized, described, and allowed you to schedule these opportunities, which was very helpful.

At times I have felt rudderless, not knowing the correct classes to take for my degree plan. However, RadGrad reveals many different options with in-depth descriptions, allowing me to make an informed decision to further my degree path. 

To me, RadGrad seems to be most valuable in regard to the networking opportunities that it could potentially bring about.

RadGrad makes those pathways clear and allows me to seek out and work with different people from different clubs and organizations who are at the same stage of development as me. Being able to network and work with other people will only enrich my own experience. Also, working with people who have already completed the requirements that I am currently working on, will help me to make more informed career/degree decisions to minimize wasted efforts and time.

I found my experience on RadGrad to be insightful and helpful in the guidance of my future.

I feel like Rad-grad will be quite helpful for planning a fulfilling college experience.

It was really motivating to look through all of the cool classes I could potentially take, and I am now more excited about my degree than I was before.

The only thing I don't quite like is that it seems as though the platform doesn't take in to account people who only want to graduate with a CS minor (not a major) .

It is also interesting to see community visibility which allows me to find my career community.

RadGrad also offers a cool feature where there is a 'level' system where it showcases a student's level, and there are six levels in total for RadGrad. A student first using RadGrad starts off as 'grasshopper' and when they continue to do extra-curricular activities/opportunities, their level goes up and the last level is 'ninja.' The level system that RadGrad has implemented can motivate and inspire students to continue to do well in their courses and in their extra-curricular activities.

The RadGrad website has opened my eyes to lots of things I never knew about computer science in general.

Going through and exploring the RadGrad page has made me become more interested in computer science and what the cs major actually does.

Overall, I would say that the planner feature is the most helpful feature on RadGrad, and with careful thinking, it can be a vital resource for any student willing to put in the time and effort.

I found the Opportunity Explorer to be the most informative and exciting feature. The explorer offers a consolidated view of the different extracurricular activities for Computer Science students. Hackathons, internships, and community-based activities are among the listed, along with their corresponding timeframes and average availability. These activities are great for building resumes and forming connections. These attributes are essential not only for paving the way to a strong career, but also for giving back to the community. The site educates students about organizations such as Purple Mai’a and others that seek to re-center Native Hawaiians, women, and people of color in technology and Computer Science.

Having a place where a simple description of the all careers that in involve computer science is extremely helpful.

Something that I wish was added is a way for you to add your (future) schedule from your star account.

the user interface and experience were functional and easy enough to understand.

The most important thing for me on RadGrad was not the career choice and creating a profile, but the degree planner.

RadGrad really opened my eyes to the world of CS and what really goes into becoming a CS major and CS as a career path. I was not aware of the many opportunities on the island for CS majors, especially the many events such as UHM events and game development group works. I appreciated that RadGrad gave us a detailed explanation and examples of what specific career paths would lead into, and even gave a short video explanation of each career.

I will definitely continue using RadGrad if given the opportunity to do so, and continue to be on top of my career and build upon it to become a outstanding graduate by the end of my college years.

There is a lot of resources on there that would be difficult to find outside of this website.

I think is something that I will definitely be using more in the future.

I also really liked the ICE system where I represents Innovation, C represents Competency, and E represents Experience because this creates a well-rounded computer science student and is important in graduate school and career.

Knowing that other people have similar interests and career focus as you creates a tightly knitted community.

I was planning to go through college just by taking the most basic courses and studying the material to earn my degree. I didn't intend to look for outside opportunities to really practice my skills as a programmer. However, after looking through the radgrad opportunities section, I realized that there's actually a lot of things I can do to gain a ton of experience and explore new areas of interest I may not have considered before. In fact, I think enhancing my experience by using these vast opportunities may be essential to ensuring I succeed.

I am very excited for the future thanks to RadGrad and have a clearer vision of what I need to be doing.

Though I'm not big on social networking myself, I did like that aspect of it and being able to connect with likeminded people pursuing the same goals as yourself.

One thing I would like to see is classes added that are outside the ICS department, for example MATH 301 Intro to Discrete Mathematics, or maybe courses that are relevant/adjacent but from a different field, like LING 431 Computational Modeling.

there are lots of clubs here at Manoa that I didn't know about until I looked on RadGrad.

At first I was confused and a little overwhelmed by the contents on the website. However, as I read the New User Tutorial carefully I realized that it was straight to the point. I found the tutorial very helpful and enjoyed the fun, simple, and easy to comprehend language that was used all throughout.

I totally did not expect there are so much I can do in this major, such as software developer, game developer, and so on.

Before using RadGrad, I was only interested in taking computer sciences courses because of my interest in UI/UX design. After using it, I have developed a new interest in virtual reality. Moreover, using RadGrad, has encouraged me to think more about my future career.

I've been trying to find a community or resources that can give me more interest about coding because even now I'm not sure if this is what i want to do. RadGrad showed me the different career paths that i can go and there's lots of field i can go and now I'm confused on what i want to do, but i find it as a good thing because now i think i can explore lots of field and i can decide which one suits me the best.

Looking at RadGrad, knowing I'm not the best person at Computer Science, makes me feel less anxious about my possible future in the job field.

Lastly, seeing all of the opportunities available reminded me that I don't need to learn these things on my own--that there are tons of people at this University who are learning as well as can help me learn. Seeing all the opportunities on RadGrad has definitely made me feel a lot better and motivated to learn Computer Science.

I know that computer science, just like computer engineering, is a major that needs more experience and capability than just GPA, and RadGrad does a great job of helping me keep track of where I am slacking and where I can improve myself to efficiently use my time in college.

The UI is great and very intuitive to use. All the classes, careers, and interests are easy to find and select. The plan overview also works really well. I like how there are reviews for classes.

Another suggestion is it would be really cool if it could somehow integrate into stargps.

With some more features I think this platform could be rolled out to other universities. While it might not be the intent, I think many university’s especially smaller ones could benefit.

While these courses were listed on the Star website and the ICS website, I think the information on RadGrad was more informative and a lot more user friendly since you can see the grid of all the courses available and are able to read and see how do these courses relate to different concepts of computer science.

I feel as if RadGrad really helps in destressing my concerns - especially academically. By going to the different interests, I am able to view a quick overview of the field in addition to the courses and professors that specialize in it! I found this especially useful

The career section gave me new possible career interests that I wasn't interested in before or didn't know about.

The planner helps me keep my computer science courses organized throughout my college career so that I know when I am taking each course and when I have time for extracurricular activities.

The RadGrad interface is very satisfying. It is intuitive, leaving little room for guessing or confusion. 

The point and level system incentivizes users to complete the various actions and take advantage of the many opportunities provided by RadGrad, and to pass their ICS courses. 

The visibility of other users in the courses/careers/opportunities/etc. also provide a sense of community and give me an idea of who might share my interests.

I'm really liking the styling you guys have done with RadGrad. Clean font and color palette. I also really like how convenient it is that it is connected to the UH system so I don't need to go through the hassle and make an account before using RadGrad. The "What's New" section is really handy. This way if a new class or opportunity comes up then we'll be able to know.

Finally, the whole idea of this is to help people succeed in computer science which it does but seems like the program to set up courses immediately feels like it's trying to rush in and dictate your future. This is due to the fact that the high priority section still can have people undecided and hold back points because of that.

Previous to learning about RadGrad, I had no idea what ICS route I wanted to go through or what classes I had to take that related to the different ICS routes.

I did like how easy and simple this website is.

Personally, I found the idea of discovering others with similar interests the most useful. I feel the most trouble I have is with networking and it was really cool to see some people I've seen in my classes with similar interests.

RadGrad was able to help open my view on how broad Computer Science is able to reach. It helped show my different interests in certain topics can be applied to Computer Science and how there are ways to combine many of my interests into a single career.

The overall design of the website makes it easy to use. It’s also very pleasing to the eye. The fact that the innovation, competency and experience bars slowly fill up as we complete courses/opportunities is also very satisfying. It motivates me to keep going.

I also enjoy that I can create my personal planner of future courses and opportunities to pursue, so that I have my set of goals in an organized fashion and engage in them step by step. With RadGrad's myICE, I can see what skills I need to improve on to become a successful undergraduate and future professional.

One of my biggest struggles that I’ve had is narrowing down specifically what career I want to go into when it comes to the broad field of Computer Science. With only exploring RadGrad for a little, I found a few specific interests that stand out to me. It was also nice that I got to read the explanations, watch introductory videos, as well as compare for myself. It is one thing to research all of these things for myself, but RadGrad makes it a little easier in the aspects of guiding and organization.

Another thing I like about the site is the level system. It's a fun and unique approach to gauging the experience students get as they fulfill course requirements and take advantage of opportunities during their time at UH Manoa. Similarly to the leveling system in games, it also adds a bit of an incentive to get more points to further advance your level.

I can feel my own growth with the increase in number(competency) which prevents me from developing imposter syndrome.

Through RadGrad I was exposed to computer science careers I didn’t even know existed like UX designer and IoT Architects. I’ve always thought that software engineering was the only career I could pursue with a computer science degree.

Another neat feature of RadGrad is that it lets you discover classmates around you that also utilize RadGrad and can help you connect with fellow classmates with the same interests or pursuit.

I will definitely be using this in the short and long-term future until I graduate.

I really enjoyed the layout and how easy it was to navigate.

One class that I was scared of was ICS 311 which I was going to take, but a review urged me to want to take the class.

Something I learned about computer science that I didn’t know before would be how many fields there are computer science related. For example, before, I thought there was only Cyber Security, Software Engineering, and Computer Engineering. Now I know that there is Data Science, Network Engineer, AI/Machine Learning Engineer, and so much more.

I did discover new interests. Starting, I was only mainly interested in coding, now I am interested in Algorithms, Application Development, Computer Graphics, and more.

Overall, I do think RadGrad is an amazing idea to help navigate students like me, and especially freshmen, to the right direction and best chance of having a successful career/degree path. I feel like there should be something like this for every major or degree. I think this because it is an interactive, personal, and informative way to decide/guide our path, future, and plan.

RadGrad had an impressive visual and interactive design and it was pleasing to the eyes and was fairly simple to use and the tutorial that was provided also helped with navigating the site as well.

Before I knew about RadGrad, I didn't know exactly how diverse computer science can be. There are many branches of computer science. You can be a web developer, an IOS app developer, software developer, virtual reality, game designer, IT management, etc. After discovering RadGrad, it gave me details like what you can do with a computer science degree. There are many careers, multiple paths. There’s not only one path, so it’s nice that you can see how flexible the curriculum can be. The future outlook for computer science is quite has a lot of variety I’d have to say.

My end goal is to become a Software Engineer, but I’ve never quite put a lot of thought into exactly what I want to explore besides web development. The interest section shows all the different things that are relevant, and other things that I may want to look into. Like Bioinformatics for example, it’s something I’ve never heard of, but now that I do, I can look into it and learn more and be more engaged with Computer Science, but through a different facet other than the courses I’m taking.

I always thought that computer science was just for smart people, but I now feel that programmers develop because we like coding. RadGrad has introduced me to many careers that computer science leads to, and I learned that there are numerous opportunities (not just the 3 tracks: game developing, cybersecurity, data analyst).

Before I began my Computer Science experience, I had a lot of anxiety when thinking about what would come after my education. There were a lot of things about languages, internships, and many more aspects of the tech space that I had little to no knowledge about. I knew that I needed experience outside of the classroom in order to build the sufficient skills of a valuable software engineer. Having an infinite amount of possible first steps causes me to feel paralyzed and indecisive on what to learn first. After being introduced to the RadGrad project, I feel that It is possible to begin my path towards a successful career as a software engineer.

Overall, I think that RadGrad is and will be an amazing resource for students like me to use in planning their classes for the next 4 years. I feel that RadGrad can help me have a better degree experience.

I am 100% going to use this resource sometime in the future, maybe around junior - senior years or possibly beyond.

I heard many things about how RadGrad was a good way to see what you can do for career goals and people were right about how RadGrad is a great website for our ICS careers.

I am still interested in becoming a Software Engineer, but seeing how many careers are available with a computer science degree is very exciting. RadGrad has simplified the process of discovering such a diverse range of career options.

I really hope to utilize RadGrad throughout my college career because it really is an amazing tool.

I have not known many careers in the computer field, the only three jobs I know when I was a freshman in college is software engineer, programmer, and web developer. In RadGrad, I learn a new career named ux designer, which is design web application based on users’ needs. I also find out the courses and extracurricular activities that related to this career. 314F21x

RadGrad is an entry way into a world of computer science I had no idea was within my reach. There were many new interests and career interests to be explored. I had no idea the number of events that go on throughout the year. 314F21x

I learned that there is something called Social Computing, this is an area where they study the interactions of social behavior and computational systems. I did not even know that was a thing until I went on RadGrad. 314F21x

On the opportunity page, I found a section about Linux and how you can learn about it in five days which is not much time at all. Yes, I could have found this if I searched google. What RadGrad offers that google does not is a tailored experience for computer science majors. 314F21x

I've always had difficulties adding extracurriculars to my resume, so the opportunities section of RadGrad caught my interest right away. When I looked into the opportunities, I found many local ones I could take advantage of, including ACM Manoa, Kaggle and Code for Hawaii. I'd actually never known about most of these activities before, and I may not ever have if it weren't for RadGrad, so I'm thankful I did. 314F21x

What I enjoyed most about this site is the Career Goals page where there’s descriptions and videos of various careers in the software field. I believe it will definitely help me in finding a job that I am interested in. 314F21x

But what really impressed me was the career goals and courses. The career goals opened my eyes to the multitude of posibilities that ICS is capable of. Many of these career paths were unknown to me till that moment. I actually found a decent ammount of careers that I wouldn’t mind exploring better. 314F21x

It has very similar functionality like Star except that it is more focus and oriented for ICS students. It has a lot of features I wish Star had. So, its presence is needed and justified. But at the same time, I wish I didn’t need to log into a separate website to use its tools.... My only wish is that Star would implement the same type of features that Radgrad has. 314F21x

At that time, I was still on the edge of whether or not I wanted to commit to pursuing a degree in computer science. Therefore, seeing this website at that time helped me to see what kind of interests I had matched up with the courses or opportunities out there. At that time, it also helped take some of the uneasiness off my shoulders because I thought that going into computer science means there are only careers related to coding. I gained new insight into how much of a variety computer science can offer. 314F21x

the opportunities section introduced me to a lot of extracurricular activities that I either barely heard of or never heard of before; I will be definitely joining a few of those. All of these sections had really useful filtering systems like “In Profile” versus “Not in Profile”, course division level, and the sortings. 314F21x

I also like that the careers, interests, and courses all relate to each other and show a sort of ‘trajectory’, like showing what courses can apply to what interests and what interests apply to what careers. 314F21x

Another issue I found is that for the courses it was only ICS courses and not other departments, for example I have to take a few mathematics courses for the Data Science track of the Computer Science BS degree and it would have been good to have that planning ability too.  314F21x

I always wanted to join a certain community and develop interaction skills with like-minded students. RadGrad provides me a various of communities that I can join and it makes a lot easier to see what community is the best fit for me. 314F21x
 
I learned that there are many different opportunities at UH for computer science that I didn't know were available to us before. I also learned more about what classes I plan to take for next semester and also the “ICE” score gave me a good gauge as to how I am doing so for my college career. 314F21x

RadGrad is a convoluted version of STAR. The RadGrad website seems a little clunky and cluttered. A lot of information is thrown to a new user and it can get confusing to follow. 314F21x

A club I will be joining is the SWITCH-UHM club. The club supports women in Information, technology and computing at the university and I never knew it existed before. I think it is important to be surrounded by people that support you and encourage you and I think it even more important to be around people that may be in the same situation such as the same ICS classes... I look forward to joining this club and to meeting and making friends that are also fellow computer science chicas. 314F21x

RadGrad definitely is helpful for a better degree experience and an overall experience at UH at Manoa. I did not know half of the clubs and opportunities that the school offered until I saw them on RadGrad. 314F21x

I used to believe that Robotics involved just mechanical engineering and electrical engineering but was surprised to find out thanks to RadGrad that it also involves computer science. 314F21x

Ever since I was little, I always thought that getting good grades was the most important factor in getting a good job. During high school I barely joined any clubs or attended many events that my school held, since I would always prioritize my studies. Going into college I thought the same way, only studying to get A’s while not joining any clubs or honor societies that were offered. However, I soon found out about the significance of being a part of different organizations and societies as well as obtaining real world experience. Through the University of Hawaii at Manoa’s RadGrad website, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of what I need to do in order to be in the best position to get a good job out of college. RadGrad denoted three important aspects to grow in which were innovation, competency, and experience. In my case, my competency score was very high, since this was based on grades, however both my innovation and experience categories were zero. The innovation category was based on taking part in activities such as research projects or hackathons, while the experience category was based on having internships or business plan competitions. This was very striking to me since it clearly showed me that grades are only one third of the whole picture and what I was lacking in. 314F21x

This summer, I plan to use radGrad to find internship opportunities for myself and perhaps participate more in activities related to my degree. Knowing how helpful radGrad can be now, I plan on using it for the rest of my attendance at UH 314F21x

I have not known many careers in the computer field, the only three jobs I know when I was a freshman in college is software engineer, programmer, and web developer. In RadGrad, I learn a new career named ux designer, which is design web application based on users’ needs. 314F21x

RadGrad is a good example of an informational hub where students can view and read about opportunities related to their field. For example, I learned of research project groups, competitions, and other learning opportunities that I’d never heard of. I feel like these can be great for helping students build their resume of out-of-class learning and experiences. 314F21x

The design of the RadGrad site is visually appealing and the tutorial for completing a basic profile was easy to understand. The descriptions for the different topics of interest, career choices, ICS catalog courses, and opportunities were also well written. 314F21x

Each course should have a tag associated with its frequency in offering (eg. every semester, fall/or spring only, every other year, not offered in the last 5* years). If a course is offered "every other year", it should also have an additional tag with the "year" in which it was last offered. (Note: 5 years is a placeholder. But courses that haven't been offered in a while should be flagged because either 1) they need to be offered soon or 2) removed from the schedule (so a student doesn't wait for it). There should be an additional "Sort By" in Courses so that students see only courses associated with their desired degree (eg. BS in Data Science, BS in Computer Science, Masters in Computer Science). As students are filling out the Planner, there should be an interactive tool or at least a pop-up document that shows the course requirements for a degree pathway (eg. BS in Data Science, BS in Computer Science, Masters in Computer Science). 314F21x

## ICS314s22

Previously, I thought that Computer science was just about writing code. Now that I saw RadGrad, I see that there are hundreds of interest categories available to focus on. 

The most unique thing about radgrad is the ICE point system. It stands for Innovation, Competency, and Experience. It keeps track of the amount of points acquired from completed courses and opportunities. This is a useful system that helps students know what should be focused as they progress forward.

I felt that the Rad Grad tutorial was very insightful and introduced me to a bunch of new topics in the computer science realm. 

I believe the RadGrad updating system can work as a very good community builder.

I discovered new opportunities for classes and extracurricular activities that I had not known before.

In the RadGrad program, I was able to rearrange my schedule for each semester of university and plan ahead as to what courses, extracurriculars, and internships I would plan on taking. This was extremely useful. Having every activity or course that interested me laid out by semester was awesome. 

When I looked at the Opportunity Explorer, I was amazed when there were 57 opportunities that were offered. These opportunities were also very diverse and had many different categories like clubs, competitions, and hackathons to name a few. I knew these events and groups were around, but I’ve never seen them all in one place like how RadGrad displays them. I’ve thought about doing more extracirricular activities, but never really knew where to get started. RadGrad makes it easy by giving a list of many possible groups to join as well as events to attend to show how many opportunities are actually available to me.

After spending about an hour going through RadGrad, I learned a lot more about courses, opportunities, and possible career interests. These are all things I hear older people talking about, but I never spend a lot fo time thinking about them myself. I just let Laulima tell me what classes to take, say I’ll think about opportunities later, and tell people I don’t know what I want to do in the future. RadGrad forced me to actually think about the classes I’m going to be taking. RadGrad also showed me opportunities available to me and made me choose some. RadGrad also made me choose computer science related jobs and see what common interests they share. Overall, in the hour or two I spent working on my RadGrad profile, I learned a lot about future classes, opportunities I can take advantage of, and several possible career choices.

When I used to think about computer science, I would have a mental image of thousands of lines of code for some tech company to use in their newest product, for example a router, but I never realized how computer science could be used in so many non-technical fields. As someone who has always been extremely interested in social issues, I was really interested to hear about some of the applications and opportunities people are working on.

I was also happy to see the Society of Women Engineers at UH Manoa, as this industry is quite male-dominated and organizations like these are making the IT industry much less intimidating for women and encouraging them to partake.

In the past, I feel as if I have missed out on many opportunities (such as joining a club) only because I did not know about them! With RadGrad, I am able to filter through different kinds of opportunities and stay updated on whatever is being offered lately. 

There are definitely a lot more opportunities out there than I was previously aware of and I appreciate that they are very specialized; allowing you to focus on things you’re actually interested in. RadGrad also opened my eyes to the immense range of computer science in that there are so many different and unique jobs within it. 

Prior to signing up for RadGrad, I had not heard of a majority of the opportunities listed. There are a lot of global, as well as local, opportunities that look very interesting to me and fit well with my goals.

I find it awesome that it allows you to view which of your peers are interested in similar topics or programs and I believe it could lead to genuine connections in the future. 

One more thing I found very intriguing is the innovation, competency, and experience levels. The fact that RadGrad is pushing students to push themselves in all aspects of computer science is very awesome to me.

I’m plagued by the same question that most students experience at some point during their education. What is my final destination? While this question creates a wall of uncertainty, a tool exists to give my journey direction. It’s called RadGrad. This simple web-app is one of the best tools for ICS students graduating from Manoa. 

I wasn’t aware of all the different societies and events related to ICS. The one thing I knew when I chose to become an ICS major was that I was going to need to be involved in teams of like minded individuals. Welp, RadGrad showed me that there existed a massive community for people interested in involving themselves with these organized events, meetups, and online discussions related to ICS.

Additionally, like most students, I based my academic and professional success on my GPA, and, RadGrad has allowed me to see the lack of projects in my field of studies. In this case, RadGrad indicated that I had a lack of “Innovation” the “I” in ICE. It then provided me with upcoming opportunities that would allow me to gain innovation points such as “research projects, hackathons, or other activities producing new insights or technologies.” 

My first time I had to come to class I felt so lost and unsure of where I was going. I also do not know any of the clubs that are offered or the various opportunities that are available to us. Radgrad has helped me to get a better understanding of the different opportunities. It takes my interests and goals into consideration and is able to give me a list of opportunities tailored to me. Radgrad has also helped me to plan my remaining semesters while adding in the different opportunities I can take advantage of.

Being a Computer Science major and a female I am already stressing out with making sure I am learning my material and proving that I am able to hold my own. However, with Radgrad I am able to feel a weight lifted off my shoulders knowing I have the resources I need to potentially succeed after graduation.

It was hard to navigate around the site, the features were not very intuitive, and overall I just didn’t find myself getting much value from the application.

I think what was interesting about exploring the opportunities section is all of the programs listed detailed information on it, how to join, and how it aligns with what you are looking to improve, which definitely helps you tailor what you want to build your skill set and experience in. Especially since it has a feature where you can sort it by recommendation and the ones that align to your interests can be filtered towards the top. Some interesting ones I saw were ‘Cracking the Coding Interview,’ ‘AllNet,’ ‘Google Summer of Code,’ and etc. I think it just kind of opened a new world for me that I had an inkling existed, but finally confirmed and revealed. I felt like a toddler at a candy store, the world was at my fingertips. There were so many options. It kind of made my worries look smaller. It was reassuring to think, the world isn’t as limited as you think it is, so long as you’re searching. 

After spending some time with Rad Grad, I was able to discover many opportunities that I was never aware of. Coming into the Computer Science degree a little after my first year of college, I had no clear goals in mind throughout my journey at UH. However, having something like Rad Grad lay out all of your options and challenges to level up your skill set before going out to the work field felt very reassuring. Rad Grad is a definitely a powerful tool that should be available to not just ICS students, but for anyone trying to gain something special that stands out from the others, something other than GPA.
