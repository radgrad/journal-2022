	abstract = {Designing and assessing learning outcomes could be a challenging activity for any Software Engineering (SE) educator. To support the process of designing and assessing SE courses, educators have been applied the cognitive domain of Bloom's taxonomy. However, to the best of our knowledge, the evidence on the usage of Bloom's taxonomy in SE higher education has not yet been systematically aggregated or reviewed. Therefore, in this paper we report the state of the art on the usage of Bloom's taxonomy in SE education, identified by conducted a systematic mapping study. As a result of the performed systematic mapping study, 26 studies were deemed as relevant. The main findings from these studies are: i) Bloom's taxonomy has mostly been applied at undergraduate level for both design and assessment of software engineering courses; ii) software construction is the leading SE subarea in which Bloom's taxonomy has been applied. The results clearly point out the usefulness of Bloom's taxonomy in the SE education context. We intend to use the results from this systematic mapping study to develop a set of guidelines to support the usage of Bloom's taxonomy cognitive levels to design and assess SE courses.},

Even in times of high enrollment, fostering a sense of belonging cannot occur just through ad-hoc methods, the goodwill of a few faculty, or a standalone mentoring program. Policies and structures must be put into place and enacted holistically. We report on a multi-phase, 10-year case study of undergraduate student experiences at the University of Illinois (2007, n=61; 2017, n=339). Our 2017 study explores the policies and structures enacted over a decade and their impact on departmental culture. We report on three areas: i) Inclusive classroom experiences; ii) Quality of mentorship opportunities; iii) Student sense of identity. While there have been significant departmental improvements, there are some cultural, policy, and structural issues to be addressed in order to foster a sense of belonging and success for all students.},

	abstract = {Rise Up 4 CS was created at Georgia Tech in the spring of 2013 to help African American students succeed in their Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science A (CSA) high school course and on the exam. The AP CSA course is intended to be equivalent to a college level CS1 course. In the fall of 2014, Sisters Rise Up 4 CS was also created to help female students succeed. Rise Up (RU) and Sisters Rise Up (SRU) both offer remote and in-person help sessions led by undergraduate students, who serve as near-peer role models. The long-term goal of these projects is to attract more underrepresented students to computing careers by increasing their self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is the belief that one can succeed in a particular task or field. Thanks to generous support from Google, RU and SRU have been offered at several other colleges and universities as well. This paper summarizes the results from spring 2013 to summer 2016, reports on an alumni survey answered by 68 (32\%) of the 211 alumni, and includes excerpts from five semi-structured interviews. The majority (63\%) of the alumni survey respondents, who are in college, are majoring in computing. A similar percentage of the alumni who are still in high school intend to major in computing (62\%). When asked about the programs' impact on their career choices and interest in computing, 61\% of respondents indicated that the program increased their interest in computer science and 24\% indicated that it changed their career plans to computing.},

	abstract = {Retaining students in computer science (CS) courses and majors is a concern for many undergraduate CS programs in the United States. A large proportion of students who initially declare a major in CS do not complete a CS degree. The impact of future-oriented motivational constructs such as career aspirations and future connectedness on retention has received relatively little research attention, but these are potential contributors to students' retention in CS courses. The purpose of this study was to investigate how future-oriented motivation related to CS students' retention in CS courses over three consecutive semesters. Students enrolled in CS courses (four 100-level courses, one 200-level course, three 300-level courses, and five 400-level courses) completed survey measures of future-oriented motivation, and course enrollment data were collected for the three semesters. Logistic regression was used to determine whether motivation variables could distinguish between students who were enrolled in at least one CS course during a given semester and students who were not enrolled in any CS courses. Results indicate that, across all three semesters, career aspirations and knowledge of CS career paths were associated with a greater likelihood of continuing to take CS courses, and stronger future connectedness was associated with a lower likelihood of continuing to take CS courses. Implications for CS educators are discussed.},

Since 2013, the Mobile CSP project has trained more than 700 teachers, and the course has been offered to more than 20,000 students throughout the United States. The organizing philosophy behind the Mobile CSP course is that student engagement in the classroom is the key to getting students, especially those traditionally underrepresented in CS, interested in pursuing further study and careers in CS. The main strategies used to engage Mobile CSP students are: (1) a focus on mobile computing throughout the course, taking advantage of current student interest in smartphones; (2) an emphasis on getting students building mobile apps from day one, by utilizing the highly accessible App Inventor programming language; and (3) an emphasis on building creative, 'socially useful' apps to get students thinking about ways that computing can help their communities. In this paper we present and summarize two years of data of various types (i.e., student surveys, teacher surveys, objective assessments, and anecdotal reports from students and teachers) to support the hypothesis that engagement of the sort practiced in the Mobile CSP course not only helps broaden participation in CS among hard-to-reach demographics, but also provides them with a solid grounding in computer science principles and practices.},

SDT argues that when students feel equally competent, autonomous, and related to others, they will be intrinsically motivated to study. This paper applies SDT to young women in computer science to identify the best ways to motivate them towards intrinsic motivation to study computer science. Using a survey administered at Bit by Bit, a conference for young women in computer science, this paper identifies that relatedness is significantly more important for girls than either competency or autonomy. Additionally, it determines the psychological pathway through which feeling related to others influences students' motivation. Specifically, it determines that feeling related to others influences young women's sense of self-efficacy, which improves their computer science motivation. These findings contribute to our understanding of SDT and of how to motivate young women to study computer science.},

This book found that boys and girls had different experiences with computers in the home and school environment, and that these different experiences had a direct impact on the desire of students to study computing. We wanted to know if the explanations Margolis and Fisher found were applicable for students in a more typical CS program in 2017, so we conducted a study to investigate the home and pre-college experiences of students who are currently majoring in CS or Computer Engineering (CE), and these students' pathway into computing majors. We recruited 11 participants from a large public institution in the Midwest U.S., and conducted interviews of these students using a protocol adapted from UTC. We performed a qualitative iterative and inductive analysis of these interviews and found that while technology access had greatly improved, views and attitudes were much slower to change. We discovered that fathers preferentially teaching sons about computing, while less prevalent than it was in UTC, still occurs. We also found that the participants, including the women, had more diverse pathways into computing than what Margolis and Fisher found. This suggests that UTC needs to be fully replicated at broad range of institutions to get a more complete picture of the multitude of pathways women use to enter into computing careers.},

	abstract = {The underrepresentation within computer science of women, domestic students of color, and students with lower socioeconomic-status remains a national issue. Recent studies demonstrate two critical factors: Persistent stereotypes about "who does computer science" can preclude interest in the field for members of these groups; many also perceive computing as "irrelevant" and "asocial". While these issues must be addressed at multiple ages and levels, many suggest that we should start early, before students have developed stereotypes. As a step in combating (mis-)perceptions of ability and relevance, we developed and conducted a spectrum of week-long summer "code camps" for regional middle-school students. These camps emphasize meaningful uses of computing, on building self-efficacy, and on broadening understanding of who does and can do computer science. In this paper, we focus on our "data science for social good" (ds4sg) camp, in which students explored computational approaches to data science through a lens of computing for social good, discovering how computing helps them not only better understand societal issues but also convince others to address problems. We discuss the rationale for the curriculum and its content, including our uses of pair programming, personal projects, and a growth model that brings students from block-based programming to professional Jupyter data notebooks. We consider the short-term effects the camps have on students' self-efficacy and perceptions of computer science. We conclude with recommendations and guidelines for those intending to offer similar camps.},

In December of 2017, the Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education published Cybersecurity Curricula 2017: Curriculum Guidelines for Post-Secondary Degree Programs in Cybersecurity [6] (CSEC2017), representing a new discipline in ACM's Computing Curricula Series [5]. Now the ACM CCECC (Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges) is leading creation of a similar set of guidelines for two-year cybersecurity programs at the associate-degree level, called CSEC2Y. This special session, led by the ACM CCECC, will engage participants in the curriculum development process for associate-degree programs in the increasingly important field of cybersecurity. Participants will have the opportunity to review the current CSEC2Y draft and related materials, to recommend changes, plan further revisions, and otherwise assist in crafting the curricular guidance.},

	abstract = {Embedded systems pervade nearly every aspect of modern life. Moreover, the emergence of both mobile platforms and Internet of Things (IoT) is furthering their reach. Although embedded systems are one of the bodies of knowledge in the ACM/IEEE-CS Com- puter Engineering Curricula, they have only passing mention in the ACM/IEEE-CS Computer Science Curricula. Inclusion of embedded systems concepts in undergraduate computer science can facilitate many objectives: a) they are an example of Platform-Based Devel- opment, a prominent theme in the ACM 2013 CS Curricula, b) they are often a more suitable level of complexity for educational needs than other "real world" platforms (e.g., Arduinos may be used to introduce many AP CS Principles in a single course), c) they offer a novel form of engagement, which may enhance diversity, and d) emerging areas, like IoT, are increasing demand for professionals that understand the full span of systems, from low-level firmware, to middleware and cloud computing. This panel represents three methods of including embedded systems concepts in undergraduate computer science: 1) use of em- bedded systems to improve engagement in a non-major computing course, 2) a required course covering core content for both com- puter science and computer engineering majors, and 3) a degree program offering a formal emphasis in embedded systems via a complementary set of courses. The panelists will share their motiva- tions for including embedded systems concepts in their programs, their approaches to integrating the content into their curricula, the teaching methods they use, the challenges they faced, and chal- lenges that remain.},

This study's goal is to explore how logistical and conceptual challenges emerge while designing a comprehensive K12 computer science program in a public school district. While the policy infrastructure for K12 computer science education is rapidly developing, few districts have yet implemented computer science as a core discipline in their K12 programs and very little research has explored the challenges involved in putting ideas into practice. This study reports on a committee designing a comprehensive K12 computer science education program at a small public school district in California. Through a grounded-theory qualitative interpretation of committee-member interviews and board meeting transcripts, we surfaced three themes which were the primary points of tension: how computer science is defined, how it ought to be taught, and what process ought to be used to answer these questions. Grounding these tensions in the academic discourse on K12 computer science education, this study offers recommendations to other districts designing comprehensive computer science education and suggests future directions of computer science education research that will be most useful to stakeholders of these processes.},

One evidence-based approach to address these challenges is Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL), in which student teams work on classroom activities specifically designed to help them construct understanding and develop key skills. While POGIL has been widely used and studied in Chemistry and other STEM fields, much less is known about how it is used in Computer Science. In this study, we examined how faculty adopt POGIL for the first time in introductory CS classrooms. Using qualitative in-depth interviews, we investigated why faculty chose to adopt POGIL and their concerns about using it. Our results suggest that faculty motivations to use POGIL centered around improving student outcomes, including their learning and engagement. However, faculty also had concerns about using POGIL, which ranged from how POGIL impacts the curriculum to logistical and institutional barriers. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to faculty development and active learning pedagogies.},

However, as the CSEC 2017 guidelines do not define what constitutes a standalone undergraduate cybersecurity degree, the computing community needs to agree on parameters of what such a degree ought to be. To this end, ABET has created flexible accreditation criteria for cybersecurity programs guided extensively by CSEC 2017 and community input. These criteria were used to conduct pilot accreditation visits of four distinct cybersecurity programs in 2017-18. This panel discusses benefits, challenges, and costs of cybersecurity program accreditation. The panelists, who represent the first four ABET-accredited cybersecurity programs, will discuss major curricular features of their programs, their motivation for participating in the pilot accreditation, the effort in preparing for accreditation, and the benefits anticipated both for their programs and the larger computing community due to program accreditation},

This creates the need for every CS student to be equipped with foundational knowledge in this collective paradigm and to possess some hands-on experience in deploying and managing big data applications in the cloud. We argue that, for substantial coverage of big data and cloud computing concepts and skills, the relevant topics need to be integrated into multiple core courses across the undergraduate CS curriculum rather than creating additional standalone core or elective courses and performing a major overhaul of the curriculum. Our approach to including these topics is to develop autonomous learning modules for specific core courses in which their coverage might find an appropriate context. In this paper, three such modules are discussed and our classroom experiences during these interventions are documented. So far, we have achieved reasonable success in attaining student learning outcomes, enhanced engagement, and interests. Our objective is to share our experience with the academics who aim at incorporating similar pedagogy and to receive feedback about our approach.},

	abstract = {*** Invited as a paper from Ed-Media 2011 *** While teachers in cyber charter schools play the important role of supporting students, many of these schools also rely heavily on the parents or guardians of students to act as co-educators. Teachers are no longer the sole providers of instruction. However, little is known about the roles of parents or guardians, referred to as learning coaches, and there are concerns over the quality of educational support they give students. The purpose of this exploratory study was to elucidate the roles of teachers and parents in a cyber charter school. The findings revealed that teachers traded in their student management responsibilities to focus on being content experts and facilitators, while learning coaches assumed responsibility for managing their own children and for guiding them through the curriculum. Challenges arose when their roles crossed paths, or when it was unclear who should be ultimately accountable for the student’s academic progress. Implications from this study suggested that (a) there is a need to better understand how to articulate their roles to enable them to be more effective at supporting their students and (b) that these co-educators may need training and support specific to these dynamic roles.},

society wonders why there are not more women involved in computing. Statistics on women’s representation in all levels of
the postsecondary academic pipeline, and in professions outside of the academy, have been bleak for decades. In response to this, social scientists have taken great interest in understanding why this cultural phenomenon exists. Although women’s
underrepresentation may seem intractable due to many years of stagnancy, we urge readers to take heart, and capitalize on the cultural climate, which places great emphasis on promoting gender equity and diversity in computing.

In this article, we review a number of factors that explain women’s low participation in and attrition from computing,
which have been developed through empirical research. We then articulate actionable items that can be implemented “on the
ground” in classrooms and professional settings, as well as “on the books” at the administrative and public policy level. We
conclude by urging readers to consider this a “people’s issue” rather than a “women’s issue”, because all people can benefit
from environments, cultural beliefs and policies that espouse inclusivity and equity.},

For the purposes of this paper, we work from this definition: A theory of change is a predictive assumption about the relationship between desired changes and the actions that may produce those changes.

	abstract = {Data relating to university students' engagement is collected internationally via several large-scale student surveys such as the North American National Survey of Student Engagement. The instruments employed measure the extent to which students put their efforts into activities associated with effective learning. It is claimed that these process measures act as a reliable proxy for student attainment, and there appears to be some evidence to support this. So far, there has been little work done to investigate engagement instruments and the data they generate from a subject perspective. This paper brings together data relating to Computer Science (CS) across the range of major engagement surveys. The results of this meta-analysis appear to indicate that CS rates lower than average on many of the major engagement benchmarks and in some cases, considerably so. Particular benchmark areas giving cause for concern are identified prompting questions as to how these results should be interpreted and used in the context of a particular learning domain. We also critique aspects of the surveys themselves, suggesting that further research is needed to better understand their appropriateness for individual subjects or for groups of subjects with shared traits. The paper argues that more qualitative data is required and that other measures (such as student expectation and some subject-specific measures) are needed for a greater understanding of the CS student experience.},

Unfortunately, Computer Science (CS) rates fairly poorly on a number of measures in these surveys, even when compared to related STEM disciplines. Initial research suggests reasons for this poor performance may include a lack of awareness by CS academics of these instruments and the student engagement measures they are based on, and a misalignment between these instruments and the research focus of computing educators, leading to misdirected efforts in research and teaching practice. In this working group we carry out an in-depth analysis of international student engagement instruments to facilitate a greater awareness of the international benchmarks and what aspects of student engagement they measure. The working group also examine the focus of current computing education research and its alignment to student engagement measures on which these instruments are based. Armed with this knowledge, the computing education community can make informed decisions on how best to respond to these measures and consider ways to improve our performance in relation to other disciplines. In particular it is important to understand why certain measures of student engagement are built into these instruments, how these align to our current research practice or even to provide feedback to the designers of these instruments from a CS perspective.},

	abstract = {In this article, I review the diverse ways in which perceived self-efficacy
contributes to cognitive development and functioning. Perceived self-efficacy
exerts its influence through four major processes. They include cognitive,
motivational, affective, and selection processes. There are three different
levels at which perceived self-efficacy operates as an important contributor to
academic devellopment. Students' beliefs in their efficacy to regulate their own
learning and to master academic activities determine their aspirations, level of
motivation, and academic accomplishments. Teachers' beliefs in their personal
efficacy to motivate and promote learning affect the types of learning
environments they create and the level of academic progress their students
achieve. Faculties' beliefs in their collective instructional efficacy contribute significantly to their schools' level of academic achievement. Student body characteristics influence school-level achievement more strongly by altering faculties' beliefs in their collective efficacy than through direct affects on school achievement.},

Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), an 81-item, self-report instrument consisting
of 6 motivation subscales and 9 learning strategies scales. The MSLQ has proven to be a
reliable and useful tool that can be adapted for a number of different purposes for researchers,
instructors, and students. TheMSLQ has been translated into multiple languages and has been
used by hundreds of researchers and instructors throughout the world. This article reviews the
history of theMSLQ and discusses how it has been used to (a) address the nature of motivation
and use of learning strategies in different types of content areas and target populations; (b) help
refine our theoretical understanding of motivational constructs, how they are distinct from one another, and what individual differences exist in self-regulated learning; and (c) evaluate the motivational and cognitive effects of different aspects of instruction.},

(MSLQ), which consists of fifteen subscales designed from classic social–cognitive learning theories and
which is widely used to predict academic performance. Results based on 2158 correlations from 67
independent samples and 19,900 college students indicate that the subscales of the MSLQ vary in their utility
for predicting grades, with grade-related validities ranging from ρ=.40 for the subscale measuring students'
effort regulation to ρ=.05 for the subscale measuring students' help-seeking behaviors. Factor-analyses of
the meta-analytic intercorrelations broadly support the theoretical structure of the MSLQ. Alteration or elimination of items with undesirable psychometric characteristics could potentially both augment empirical support for the theoretical structure of the MSLQ and strengthen its subscales' predictive utility for academic performance.},

The authors used path analyses to examine the ways in which exposure to quality secondary learning environments contributed to the development of self-efficacy, motivation, and academic achievement among 135 high school students receiving special education services. Students with disabilities who reported having greater involvement in learning environments reflecting recommended transition practices (i.e., high-quality learning environments) demonstrated increased career-search self-efficacy. Students
with greater career-search self-efficacy were more highly engaged in goal setting, which further predicted their motivation
to attend school and academic self-efficacy. Finally, students with higher academic self-efficacy were found to have higher grades. The authors offer recommendations for enhancing the self-determination skills and opportunities of youth with disabilities by strengthening the quality and impact of transition education.},

Some researchers suggest that it could also be used in web based education as a tool to increase student motivation and engagement. In an attempt to verify those theories, we have designed and built a gamification plugin for a well-known e-learning platform. We have made an experiment using this plugin in a university course, collecting quantitative and qualitative data in the process. Our findings suggest that some common beliefs about the benefits obtained when using games in education can be challenged. Students who completed the gamified experience got better scores in practical assignments and in overall score, but our findings also suggest that these students performed poorly on written assignments and participated less on class activities, although their initial motivation was higher.},

The primary unit of analysis of this process is neither the individual nor social institutions, but the informal 'communities of practice' that people form as they pursue shared enterprises over time. To give a social account of learning, the theory explores in a systematic way the intersection of issues of community, social practice, meaning, and identity. The result is a broad framework for thinking about learning as a process of social participation. This ambitious but thoroughly accessible framework has relevance for the practitioner as well as the theoretician, presented with all the breadth, depth, and rigor necessary to address such a complex and yet profoundly human topic.},

	abstract = {A new organizational form is emerging in companies that run on knowledge: the community of practice. And for this expanding universe of companies, communities of practice promise to radically galvanize knowledge sharing, learning, and change. A community of practice is a group of people informally bound together by shared expertise and passion for a joint enterprise. People in companies form them for a variety of reasons--to maintain connections with peers when the company reorganizes; to respond to external changes such as the rise of e-commerce; or to meet new challenges when the company changes strategy. Regardless of the circumstances that give rise to communities of practice, their members inevitably share knowledge in free-flowing, creative ways that foster new approaches to problems. Over the past five years, the authors have seen communities of practice improve performance at companies as diverse as an international bank, a major car manufacturer, and a U.S. government agency. Communities of practice can drive strategy, generate new lines of business, solve problems, promote the spread of best practices, develop people's skills, and help companies recruit and retain talent. The paradox of such communities is that although they are self-organizing and thus resistant to supervision and interference, they do require specific managerial efforts to develop them and integrate them into an organization. Only then can they be fully leveraged. The authors explain the steps managers need to take in order to get communities going-and to sustain them so they can become a central part of their companies' success.

First, to determine the extent to which states are leveraging federal and state resources to align their ILP initiatives with other policies aimed at fostering education innovation and assisting economic recovery. The second goal was to develop policy recommendations for making intergovernmental investments to
strengthen performance outcomes in education and workforce development in ILP/IGP states. The federal interest in equal protection and improving equity for special populations including youth with disabilities stimulated and animated the investigation. Several key findings emerged across the four states. First, to date limited fiscal investments in professional development and systematic data collection have constrained ILP-IGP implementation and evaluation efforts. Second, the opportunity to align and leverage the state investment with federal programs and other state
employment and education initiatives was largely unexplored in these states. Recommendations for state policy improvements include aligning ILP policies with state plans for improving outcomes in federal programs for students confronting economic, language, and disability challenges.},

Data were collected from interviews with 31 students enrolled in introductory CS courses at two public universities in the United States. Here we elaborate on our grounded theory of one of these factors: how students assess their fit with CS. We describe how students measure their fit with CS in terms of the amount they see themselves as expressing the traits of singular focus, asocialness, competition, and maleness and how students make interpretations and decisions based upon these measurements. We found that students’ interpretations were influenced by their attitudes toward the nature of stereotypes.},

Staffing and consulting firm Randstad North America recently performed a survey among 1,000 11- to 17-year-old students and found there's a misunderstanding of what STEM jobs are available. That, in turn, is making fewer kids and young adults interested in pursuing the field as a career later in life.

"Over half of the students (52\%) say they don't know anyone with a job in STEM, revealing broad unfamiliarity with STEM skills and misperceptions about where these skills can be applied," the study says.},

Maybe they failed a crucial prerequisite course, or found little to engage their interest in their introductory courses, or failed to see the relevance of what they were being taught. For non-majors, an introductory course that confirms their preconception that they are “bad at science” may be the last science course they ever take.

Evidence from research on learning and teaching in science and engineering suggests that a large part of the problem lies in the way these courses are traditionally taught—through lectures and reading assignments, note-taking and memorization, and laboratories with specific instructions and a predetermined result.

A 2012 report by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Engage to Excel, sizes up the issue in this way:
Traditional teaching methods have trained many STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] professionals, including most of the current STEM workforce. But a large and growing body of research indicates that STEM education can be substantially improved through a diversification of teaching methods. These data show that evidence-based teaching methods are more effective in reaching all students—especially the “underrepresented majority”—the women and members of minority groups who now constitute approximately 70\% of college students. (p. i)

To learn science and engineering well at the undergraduate level, students must understand in depth the fundamental concepts of a discipline. They must develop skills in solving problems and working with the tools of science and be able to apply these skills to new and somewhat different tasks. They must understand the nature and practices of science or engineering and be able to critically evaluate information.},

	abstract = {A casual analysis of the Hawaii technology community site, TechHui, suggests that over the past decade, recent alumni and current undergraduates of the Information and Computer Science (ICS) program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) have experienced several problems with various academic, professional, and social aspects of their ICS experience. Existing degree planning systems such as STAR, Starfish by Hobsons, Blackboard Planner and Coursicle fail to provide the specific support that ICS students need to create a complete and comprehensive degree plan. Existing academic social networks such as LinkedIn, TechHui and Rate My Professors fail to connect students closely with professors and alumni. Current popular video games suggest that several gamification features could encourage ICS students to achieve higher goals. A new system called RadGrad combines degree planning, social networking, and gamification in a novel way that aims to give ICS undergraduates the support they need to succeed and redefines what it means to have a successful degree experience. The overall goal of this thesis is to justify the initial RadGrad system design and establish baseline values for future studies. A baseline student survey conducted in Spring 2017 reveals current and more detailed student perceptions on the academic, professional, and social aspects of the ICS degree experience prior to using RadGrad. These baseline results can be used in a future study to measure if RadGrad has had any effects on the students.},

Many believe lack of interest to be rooted in stereotypes of computer science formed early in high school: that it is a boring subject, devoid of interesting applications and stimulating only to 'geeks'. To attract high school females to CS, and to determine whether early exposure to the interesting breadth of CS and its applications might ameliorate such attitudes, a week-long Computer Science Seminar for Grade 9 and 10 girls was held at the University of Waterloo. The seminar consisted of lectures, labs and activities chosen to demonstrate the breadth of CS and to dispel the negative stereotypes. Pre- and post-seminar surveys indicate a substantial increase in interest, translating directly into increased desire to take high school CS courses.},

In this position paper, we review justice-centered approaches to CS education, problematize the lack of justice-centered approaches to CS in higher education in particular, and describe a justice-centered approach for undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms. Our approach emphasizes three components: (1) ethics: critiques the sociopolitical values of data structure and algorithm design as well as the underlying logics of dominant computing culture; (2) identity: draws on culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to emphasize student identity as rooted in resistance to the dominant computing culture; and (3) political vision: ensures the rightful presence of political struggles by reauthoring rights to frame CS learning as a force for social justice. Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS education can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical implications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect for diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing that are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need.},

	abstract = {Underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic women in computer science is a long-standing problem that looks bleak at every level - undergraduate and graduate. This is prompting scholars to explore reasons for these low participation rates. One framework used to understand participation and persistence in STEM fields is identity. Prior work in computer science education suggest that identity is a strong indicator of persistence in these fields. However, it is hard to understand students' perception of identity without also understanding ontological beliefs with regards to a computer scientist. In this study, we explore the nature of a computer scientist. Guided by social identity theory, we designed a study that asked students to describe their definition or ontological belief of what constitutes a computer scientist in contrast to their ability to ascribe a computer science identity to self. Leveraging qualitative methods, we interviewedn = 24 women in computer science (Black and Hispanic, undergraduate and graduate students), in order to explore the role their ontological beliefs had on their computer science identity salience. The research questions guiding this work are: (1) How do Black and Hispanic women describe or define computer scientists? (2) What impact does this definition have on Black and Hispanic women's ability to claim a computing identity? Results suggest that the wide variation in definitions has a negative impact on computer science identity salience. The findings from this work suggest that computing should consider the impacts of the current messaging of what constitutes a computer scientist.},

This type of degree has often been referred to as "CS+X" in the literature and is increasingly relevant as the need for interdisciplinary computer scientists grows. As of 2021, students at Northeastern can choose among three computing majors (Computer Science, Data Science or Cybersecurity) and 42 combined majors, which combine one of the three computing degrees with one of 29 distinct majors in other fields. Prior to 2014, combined majors were with the sciences, business and design. Over the last seven years, we created 29 new combined majors, explicitly creating combinations with fields where there has traditionally been greater gender diversity. The resulting increase in student interest and gender diversity over the last seven years is compelling. As of Fall 2020, 44.6\% of the 2,800+ computing majors at Northeastern are pursuing combined majors, 39\% of whom are women. This is substantially higher than the 21.5\% reported in IPEDS for 2019 women computing graduates in the U.S. We did not observe any significant differences in racial and ethnic diversity between combined and computing only degrees. In this experience paper, we describe how we create and manage combined majors, and we present results on enrollments, admissions, graduation, internship placements, and how students discover combined majors.},

The program, designed to provide all students the known benefits of the project-based approach, is being implemented in a context that focuses heavily on drawing students of color, women, and other underrepresented groups into STEM careers. Our Fall 2021 upper-division entering student cohort is 70\% female and 80\% people of color. Our new computer science program builds on our strong and internationally recognized track record in applying project-based learning (PBL) in engineering. We believe our PBL CS program to be the first program of its type in North America. Key components of the program are: project-based learning across multiple courses in the upper-division, project-based learning within lower-division courses, straightforward articulation with regional and national community colleges that are minority serving institutions (MSIs), industry and research connections that drive projects, and vertical integration of teams across upper-division semesters. Core to this is a commitment to addressing access and equity issues. The foundation for the new upper-division program is a revamped lower-division core curriculum that also feeds into the information technology and information systems majors offered at our school. The core curriculum is designed to reduce barriers to a degree in computing while encouraging more students to explore a degree in the math-intensive computer science program. This curricula initiative paper describes the curriculum, the supporting theory, implementation challenges, and current outcomes.},

	abstract = {How might we better address the pervasive inequities in CS education? While empirical efforts have advanced pedagogy, created innovative learning tools, and deepened our understanding of learner cognition, we are still failing many students. Disparities in who can access and who succeeds in CS persist. In this position paper I argue that we need to reconsider how we approach CS education research (CSER). Prior research discussions have focused on methodologies, but research designs are influenced by more than strategies and methods of data collection. They are also guided by philosophies of how the world works. Philosophical views dominant in CSER have served us well in answering questions such as which instructional approaches lead to greater achievement or how do alternative programming conceptions develop. However, confronting systemic problems that prevent some learners from being at the table might require a transformative research lens. I introduce critical theory as a means to put inequities and the voices of the marginalized at the fore of our research. This is demonstrated through the analysis of three examples: a narrative ethnographic analysis of the power differences in a researcher practitioner partnership serving Latinx youth; an autoethnography of a Black scholar's journey into an IT career; and a survey study examining the relationship between interest, stereotypes and CS career intentions in students from minoritized groups. Lastly, I offer a call to action for increasing the use and acceptance of critical theory in our dissemination venues and professional development opportunities.},

	abstract = {Since 2006, undergraduate interest in computer science degrees has increased significantly, marking the third period of CS enrollment growth since the field's emergence in the early 1900s. Scholars have theorized that institutional approaches to managing these cycles of enrollment growth, notably the inability to scale programs, resulted not only in the discipline's constriction, but also the disproportionate decline in the participation of Black, Latin*, and Indigenous students in computing. This history suggests that it is important for stakeholders to think intentionally about how the management of enrollment surges can hamper, or even undermine, efforts to broaden participation in CS; yet there is limited research examining whether and how stakeholders from CS departments perceive this relationship. This paper reports findings from a qualitative study of CS departments at four public research institutions in the United States to understand how 55 stakeholders perceived undergraduate enrollment and diversity trends, as well as the relationship between booming enrollments and diversity efforts within the department. We found that participants largely spoke about their diversity work without referencing the impacts of enrollment shifts in the department. When this relationship was discussed, participants varied in how they framed it as either positive, negative, or null. We argue that separating out diversity work from core priorities in the department will hinder departments' ability to sustain BPC efforts into the future. Instead, it is imperative that stakeholders understand how departmental responses to dynamic external forces (e.g., booming enrollments, shifting realities related to COVID-19) impact diversity efforts.},

	abstract = {Efforts to broaden participation in computing have led to gender-focused interventions intended to increase the number of women in the field of computing. However, such efforts have failed to significantly increase the percentage of Black women in computing. For example, only 1\% of the 28,884 bachelor{\textbackslash}textquotesingle s degrees in computing were awarded to Black women in 2018. Moreover, too few empirical studies have intentionally explored the lived experiences of Black women, an often overlooked and understudied population in the computing ecosystem. In this paper, we introduce intersectionality - the complex overlap of socially constructed identities such as race, gender, class, sexuality, etc. - as a theoretical framework and springboard for exploring the lived experiences of Black women in computing. We interview 14 Black women in various stages of the computing ecosystem (undergraduate students, graduate students and early career professionals) to understand how intersectionality influences their ability to persist in computing. Preliminary findings from the analysis of the 14 interviews provides insights into how the interlocking systems of oppression (i.e., gendered racism) play out in computing education and negatively impact the recruitment and retention of Black women in the field of computing.},

	abstract = {Enrollment in computing at the college level has skyrocketed, and many institutions have responded by enacting competitive enrollment processes. However, little is known about the effects of enrollment policies on students' experiences. To identify relationships between those policies and students' experiences, we linked survey data from 1245 first-year students in 80 CS departments to a dataset of department policies. We found that competitive enrollment negatively predicts first-year students' perception of the computing department as welcoming, their sense of belonging, and their self-efficacy in computing. Both belonging and self-efficacy are known predictors of student retention in CS. In addition, these relationships are stronger for students without pre-college computing experience. Our classification of institutions as competitive is conservative, and false positives are likely. This biases our results and suggests that the negative relationships we found are an underestimation of the effects of competitive enrollment.},

One major finding was that, for underrepresented students to major in computer science, knowing the major existed and understanding the nature of the program were the most important factors. Also, the academic support system and hands-on nature of the major had a significant impact on scholarship recipients' persistence in the major. Evidence demonstrated that scholarship recipients had a 10\%+ higher year-to-year persistence rate from their freshmen to sophomore year than that of all computer science students of the same entering classes. For all computer science students, college computer science major GPAs were not strongly correlated with their high school GPAs, financial need, or ACT math scores. This paper also presents lessons learned and resulting recommendations for future new scholarship administrators, as our lessons can likely be applied to other grants that recruit and deal with underrepresented groups.},

	abstract = {The Mobile CS Principles (Mobile CSP) course is one of the NSF-supported, College Board-endorsed curricula for the new Computer Science Principles AP course. Since 2013, the Mobile CSP project has trained more than 700 teachers, and the course has been offered to more than 20,000 students throughout the United States. The organizing philosophy behind the Mobile CSP course is that student engagement in the classroom is the key to getting students, especially those traditionally underrepresented in CS, interested in pursuing further study and careers in CS. The main strategies used to engage Mobile CSP students are: (1) a focus on mobile computing throughout the course, taking advantage of current student interest in smartphones; (2) an emphasis on getting students building mobile apps from day one, by utilizing the highly accessible App Inventor programming language; and (3) an emphasis on building creative, 'socially useful' apps to get students thinking about ways that computing can help their communities. In this paper we present and summarize two years of data of various types (i.e., student surveys, teacher surveys, objective assessments, and anecdotal reports from students and teachers) to support the hypothesis that engagement of the sort practiced in the Mobile CSP course not only helps broaden participation in CS among hard-to-reach demographics, but also provides them with a solid grounding in computer science principles and practices.},
